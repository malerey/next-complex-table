# Complex Table Playground

I've built incredibly complex tables for clients in the past, but never had the chance to publish them or plan one myself from scratch and make all the decisions. This is my playground to build the table I've always wanted to create.

Starting simple and adding features as I think of them or get annoyed by limitations.

## Current Status
- [x] Basic Next.js setup
- [x] TanStack Table installed
- [x] Basic table rendering project names
- [ ] Everything else...

## The Plan (loosely)
Build a project management table that doesn't suck. Will probably get very complex.

### Features I Want to Add Eventually:
- **Nested Data**: Expandable rows with tasks, subtasks, dependencies
- **Advanced Interactions**: Drag-and-drop file uploads, modal inline editing
- **User Customization**: Resizable columns, column visibility, saved table preferences
- **Theming**: User-controlled themes saved to profile
- **Performance**: Virtualization for large datasets, optional pagination
- **Multi-selection**: Batch operations, bulk editing/deleting
- **Offline Support**: Queue updates when offline, sync when back online
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous edits with user alerts
- **Real-time**: Live updates when multiple users are editing

### Testing (Future)
- Unit tests with Vitest
- E2E tests with Playwright (maybe)

## Running
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

That's it for now. Let's see how far this rabbit hole goes.
